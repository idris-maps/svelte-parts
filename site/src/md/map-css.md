**Are the map tiles all over the place?**

You need to use the css file `node_modules/leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`. Add it to your project however you want.

**Do the marker icons not show?**

The folder `node_modules/leaflet/dist/images` needs to be served in your build from the same folder as the css file.
